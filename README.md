And yes, I don't really know what to write, I mean a story of what, ok never mind.
One day I was on my way to the ~~beach~~ **school** we had a subject that day that talks about the *emphasis* words and what they actually mean (which I still don't know ðŸ¤“)
anyway at least I know how steps structure is, here's an example:
1. Test:
		First
		Second
		Third
		etc... :D

that is enough, I'm terrible at writing stories ðŸ˜­

```javascript
alert("Hello World");
```
That's what I really can do ðŸ¤“
